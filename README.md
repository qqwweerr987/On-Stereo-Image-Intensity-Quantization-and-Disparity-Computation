### On Stereo Image Intensity Quantization and DisparityComputation



Run **OnStereoError.py** to get the eight value of predicted error.

Note that the computaion on parameters *Interval* and *Threshold* are not contained in the code.

Please follow the approaches mentioned in the paper to compute the suitable parameters.

Image from public datasets Middlebury / KITTI2015 / Sceneflow used in our research are placed in the folder.
